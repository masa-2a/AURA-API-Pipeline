I feel like everyone around me is moving forward, and I’m stuck.
I'm not sure what to do with my life, I'm depressed.
I'm really anxious about the future, I don't know what's to come.
Something's wrong and I feel like I'm losing control.
I don't think life is worth living anymore.
I've had enough of this, what's wrong with everyone.
I haven’t slept in two days but I’m full of energy.
It’s like I’m watching my life happen from outside my body.
I feel like I have no one to talk to.
I can't do anything right, everything I do is wrong.
There's too much going on and I feel so overwhelmed.
