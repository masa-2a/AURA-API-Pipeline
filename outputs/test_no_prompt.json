Each step forward is progress, whether it feels big or small.\n3. **Limit Comparisons**: It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others, especially on social media. Consider taking a break from platforms that make you feel inadequate.\n4. **Reach Out for Support**: Talk to friends, family, or mentors about how you’re feeling. Sometimes, just sharing your thoughts can provide relief and perspective.\n5. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself.
